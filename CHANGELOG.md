# Change log

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.1] - 2023-09-22

 - Maintenance release with updated dependencies

## [1.2.0] - 2023-01-25
 
 - *BREAKING*: Channel now has two subtypes; `ReleaseChannel` and `DebugChannel`.
   - Motivation: `Meta` is captured using `Throwable.stacktrace`. This may impact performance negatively.
   - `ReleaseChannel` no longer have `Meta` passed to it's `print()` method and it can be used in Release builds.
   - `DebugChannel` are to be used in development builds.
   - `Meta` parameter in `Formatter.format()` method is now nullable.

Migrating: let your channel subtype inherit from either Release- or DebugChannel instead of Channel
