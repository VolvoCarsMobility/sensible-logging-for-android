# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

### Commit, Push \& Review
The entire process of constructing or fixing a feature or bug

1. Make sure there is a Github issue for the task at hand.
2. Branch from the latest `main` and include the issue number for your task in the branch name, e.g: `feature/#123_add_support_for_flux_capacitors` or `bugfix/#123_fix_flux_capacitor` etc.
3. Work on your branch and prepend commit messages with your issue number: `#123: enable the flux capacitor`
4. When you are ready, do a pull request and follow the PR template. Make sure you utilise the [closing keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) for the issue to be closed when merged.
5. When the number of required reviewers for PR approval coupled with CI integration success is passed, __you__ have the responsibility to merge it, do it!
